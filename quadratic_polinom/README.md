Quadratic
=========

Quadratic solve quadratic equations

## Functions:
*This programm have  functions:*
    
* **scan** - gets coefficients of polinomal from keyboard. This function couses logic function.
* **logic** - considers exceptions and get answer. This functions couses radicals_counting, discrim_counting, message functions.
* **discrim_counting** - count and return discriminant
* **radicals_counting** - get some event value and count radical depend it.
* **message** - give some event value and print answer depending on it.

## Global constants:
* POISON uses for declare variables, like as construction in C++ language.
* ###Parametres for message and radicals_counting functions:
    * ALL_NUMBERS, NO_RADICALS, ONE_RADICAL, TWO_RADICALS.
